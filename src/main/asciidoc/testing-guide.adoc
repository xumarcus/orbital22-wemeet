:toc:

Refer to source code for latest tests. Our test coverage currently has much room for improvement. This document is primarily for Orbital requirement.

== Unit testing

== Integration testing
We tested out the following API for backend.

=== User
.Creation
* Given request with invalid email, when client `POST`, then server responds with `400 Bad Request`.
* Given request with invalid password of length less than 8, when client `POST`, then server responds with `400 Bad Request`.
* Given valid request, when client `POST`, then a user is created.
* Given valid request and existing unregistered user, when client `POST`, then a user is registered.
* Given valid request and existing registered user, when client `POST`, then server responds with `400 Bad Request`.

.Read
* Given anonymous user, when client `GET /api/users/me`, then server redirects to login page.
* Given authenticated user, when client `GET /api/users/me`, then server responds with `200 OK` with the correct user information.

=== Meeting
.Creation
* Given valid request, when client `POST`, then an empty meeting is created.
* Given invalid request, when client `POST`, then server responds with `400 Bad Request`.
* Given anonymous user, when client `POST`, then server redirects to login page.

.Update
* User info for meeting
** Given new user, when owner of a meeting invites user, then the new user can read meeting data.
** Given new user, when owner of a meeting does not invite user, then the new user cannot read meeting data. (Failed, as ACL checks are disabled until v0.4.0)
** Given valid email, when owner of a meeting `POST`, then an unregistered user is persisted in the server database.
* Time slots
** Given valid request, when client `POST`, then a time slot is created for the meeting.
** Given valid request, when client `POST`, then an invited user can also read the time slot data.
** Given invalid request, when client `POST`, then server responds with `400 Bad Request`.
* User info for time slots
** Given valid request and existing time slot, when an invited user ranks one's preference, then server responds with `200 OK`.

=== Solution
.Creation
* Given valid request, when client `POST`, then solver starts running.
** Before solver terminates, when client `GET`, then server responds with `200 OK` with `solved` set to `false`
** After solver terminates, when client `GET`, then server responds with `200 OK` with `solved` set to `true` and response contains valid solution.
* Given valid request, when client `POST /api/rosterPlan/publish`, then server responds with `200 OK` and overrides original `rosterPlan`.



== User testing
=== Google Form Link for User Testing

https://forms.gle/mv4PmppxTaHfbwBq6[https://forms.gle/mv4PmppxTaHfbwBq6]

=== Methodology

Testing was done with a Google Form which systematically guides the user through each feature of WeMeet while collecting their comments. As WeMeet is meant to be a general scheduling platform, we will be doing our user testing on the general public. Emails and text messages with the user testing link were sent to friends and family. We will be conducting one round of internal testing followed by 3 rounds of user testing. As testing rounds occur, we will also be refining the features of WeMeet and making small additions to the user testing form to include them. Email addresses of respondents are collected to ensure all responses collected are legitimate.

=== Testing Process

Within the Google Form, users will follow action based instruction and conduct testing in the following sections:

. General web page navigation
. Account registration and authentication
. Scheduler functionality
. Overall feedback

=== Sample of User Testing Question
image::user-testing.png[]

=== Rationale

This approach of a guided Google Form allows us to systematically test every feature of WeMeet and gather feedback. By having it online and done at the respondent’s convenience, we are able to avoid costs associated with physical user testing sessions which may not provide additional useful information. With the comprehensive user testing process, we aim to collect comprehensive feedback on the functionality and design of WeMeet.

=== Timeline

11th - 14th July: First round  +
14th - 15th July: Review first round feedback +
15th - 18th July: Second round  +
18th - 19th July: Review second round feedback +
19th - 22nd July: Third round
22nd - 24th July: Review third round feedback

We continuously analyze and adapt to feedback, taking inspiration from the Design Thinking Methodology : Create, Test, Improve, Iterate.

=== First Round Feedback

The first round of user testing was conducted from 11th to 14th July with 4 responses.
|===
|*Section*|*Feedback Received*|*Action Taken*

|Account registration and authentication|There should be a way to reset the password.|Addition of a reset password feature via email will add additional complexity. We will schedule it to be released in the future.
|Overall feedback|The “Features” and “About” tabs were confusing.|Aforementioned tabs will be removed and replaced with a single “Guide” tab
|===


=== Second Round Feedback

The second round of user testing was conducted from 15th to 18th July with 4 responses.
|===
|*Section*|*Feedback Received*|*Action Taken*

|General web page navigation|The web page is slow to load when initially accessing it.|Heroku only “spins up” the server when users access the page which leads to the initial startup time. We will explore the pricing options for faster page loading.
|Scheduler functionality|The quick prompt shows “Add Title” when I am supposed to enter the time slot capacity|We have replaced it with “Add Capacity” to reduce confusion.
|===

=== Third Round Feedback

The third round of user testing was conducted from 19th to 22nd July with 5 responses.
|===
|*Section*|*Feedback Received*|*Action Taken*

|Scheduler functionality|The scheduler lacks more advanced features such as calendar integration.|We will include more advanced features in future updates.
|===


== System testing
System testing was conducted manually after each major revision (e.g. before each round of user testing). A developer will use
the user testing questions as a guide to test each and every functionality of the webapp to ensure that
it is functioning as expected.
