== API Reference

Almost all the API is generated by Spring Data Rest. All the requests and responses below are generated from integration tests by Spring Rest Docs. In addition, we expose a GUI at `/api/explorer` to discover API features.

.Supported HTTP Methods
* `POST /api/:resource` for creation
* `GET /api/:resource/:id` for read
* `PUT /api/:resource/:id` for update (replace with new data)
* `PATCH /api/:resource/:id` for update (modify specified fields)
* `DELETE /api/:resource/:id` for deletion
** `204 No content` if successful
